- Open Powershell window here
- pip install virtualenv
- virtualenv nameOfEnv

  To make a venv which has system's python site packages,
  'virtualenv --system-site-packages nameOfEnv

for installing packages to virtual environment, first we need to activate it in the command line

- source nameOfEnv/bin/activate [For linux based systems]
  
  'nameOfEnv\scripts\activate'    [For Windows] =======> Note: To run this, open the command prompt or powershell window through admin
				  
  There can be error so write:-

  'set-executionpolicy remotesigned'		the write 'Y' when asked

  then try activating script and it will be activated

- now, you can install any packages in the venv for eg.:-
  pip install sklearn
- 'deactivate' to deactivate the venv



By this you can use venv for command line programs just by writing 'python'
OR you can run a python file by for eg. writing 'python main.py'


If we need to send the virtual environment to someone and it has many packages installed, it is a bad method to copy and past and give the folder,
we will make a requirements.txt file:-
'pip freeze > requirements.txt' ====> Write this when venv is activated and you are in the right directory in command line
This file will have the list of all the installed packages in the python


- To delete the virtual environment, 'del nameOfEnv'
- To install packages from requirements.txt, 'pip install -r -\requirements.txt'
